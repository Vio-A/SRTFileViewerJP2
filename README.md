## why?

I frequently mine words through software to create flashcards. 

I need to download the video and then either download youtube's auto sub (unreliable) or transcribe one myself.

At the start I was using janky scripts that left some of the early viewed videos with just the video ID. 

Later on I fixed this to include the title.

After I finish the video, I delete it but keep the .srt since they're so tiny. 

Over time, I amass many .srt files from all the videos I watch.

With this program, I can visually view the many videos I've previously mined from.

I believe it's quite a niche use-case.
